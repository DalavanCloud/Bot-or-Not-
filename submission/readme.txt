Our code consists of two files: 
features.py extracts all the 15 features we used in our task. The code is set to download, extract and load data from its public source automatically. This process takes a few minutes depending on the network condition. 

classify.py trains different classifiers, runs experiments to test prediction accuracy and AUROC scores. It output information we need for the comparison and analysis.
